# Christoffel-s-menu-poe
- I added a new screen for adding dishes. The chef can now add a dish by selecting the course, name, description, and price.
- I created a delete button so the chef can remove dishes from the list.
- I added a new screen for guests to filter dishes by course (Starter, Main, or Dessert).
- I made the app show the average price per course and the overall average price of all dishes.
   I used arrays to store and display all menu items. When a dish is added or deleted, the list updates.
- I cleaned up and organized the code by using more functions instead of repeating the same code.
- I improved the layout and used a white background with dark turquoise and blue colors to match the design.
-  I added simple alerts to show messages when a dish is added or deleted.

## Refactoring Summary
- I improved my code by splitting it into smaller functions, making it easier to read and understand.
- I also separated screens (Home Screen, Add Screen, Filter Menu) and reused parts like the header and dish cards.
